## Personal Introduction

Hi, I'm Phathutshedzo Evans Munyai.

I am a BSc (Hons) Computer Science student at the University of the Western Cape with a strong focus on Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.

My passion lies in building intelligent and practical systems that solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in applying AI and data-driven approaches to impactful challenges, including public safety, predictive systems, and scalable software solutions.

Through academic research and hands-on development, I continuously refine my problem-solving, analytical thinking, and system design skills. I am driven by growth, innovation, and the desire to contribute meaningfully to South Africa’s technological advancement.

My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled Software Engineer and AI specialist, developing solutions that create measurable social and economic impact.
